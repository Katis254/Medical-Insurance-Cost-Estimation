## Description
This project demonstrates how different factors influence medical insurance cost estimations. The Python script uses a formula to calculate insurance costs based on age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status.

## Usage
### Factors Explored
The project explores the impact of the following factors on insurance costs:
- Age
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Sex (Male or Female)
- Smoking Status
- Number of Children

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:

3. Run the Python script:


4. Observe the estimated insurance costs and changes based on different factors.

## Exploring Factors
### Age Factor
The script evaluates the impact of age on insurance costs. It calculates the difference in insurance costs when the age is increased by 4 years.

### BMI Factor
The project also investigates the role of BMI in insurance cost estimations. It calculates the difference in insurance costs when the BMI is increased by 3.1.

### Male vs. Female Factor
The script explores how sex affects insurance costs. It calculates the difference in insurance costs when changing the sex from female to male.
